# Let's KIT (Keep In Touch)

> Are you tired of losing touch with old friends due to the chaos and busyness of life? Let's KIT is our solution to effortlessly stay connected. Entering the workforce or moving to a different state shouldn't mean losing meaningful friendships. Our software sends engaging bi-weekly prompts, making it easy for friends to share meaningful updates and photos of what they're up to. Our app combats loneliness and bypasses the superficiality of social media apps like Facebook or Instagram by forcing people to engage beyond short texts or an occasional photo. Let's KIT fosters genuine connections in the simplest way possible.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem

Let's KIT tackles a common issue: young adults (18-35) struggle to keep meaningful relationships during major life changes. Busy lives lead to fewer friends. Social media shows only the best, making it hard to share real thoughts. Fast communication doesn't help. People want a safe space for genuine connections. Our research confirms this need, presenting a market opportunity for our startup to fill the gap and provide a platform for authentic relationships.

### 1.2 Solution

Having a single platform to keep a friend or group of friends connected and constantly engaging with each other will help people maintain quality friendships that go beyond shallow interactions that happen on other social media platforms, such as Instagram or Snapchat.

### 1.3 Unique Value Proposition

Firstly, Let's KIT has a list of curated questions chosen by a team to ensure that groups will be able to interact with one another on a deeper level. Let's KIT is also a single platform where everything will take place, rather than having to use email. Additionally, our product provides financial management incentives when users have high engagement rates. Finally, all users will get digital mementos (similar to Spotify Wrapped or Apple Spotlight) that highlights the best parts of a group's month. For example, the digital memento would summarize the entire month with user uploaded pictures and captions. This way, everyone has something to remember and can more easily stay in the loop.

### 1.4 Channels

From our market research, the people we interviewed told us that they would recommend an app like this to other people as a solution. Therefore, we believe that word of mouth will be a big way we will acquire new users. Additionally, we plan on running ads on social media, as well as partnering with social media influencers. Finally, we also believe we can partner with travel agencies when giving away free vacations to groups.

### 1.5 Variable Costs

Since we are building a software solution, the cost incurred to create this service will be from development, sales, and advertising. Additionally, there may also be some costs associated with hosting our service on a server and domain hosting.

### 1.6 Revenue Streams

Let's KIT is fully premium, with a 14 day free trial. Therefore, we have two tiers of subscription. The premium subscription will give users key features like financial management, so a percentage of their subscription fees will be put into a "group savings" account which can be used to plan a smaller trip.

## 2. Financial Model

We estimate that we will have a user base of around 50,000 during our initial scale year which will net us \$13k in net profit all being reinvested into our startup. We estimate that we will sell more units by 48.8 percent from 2023 to 2024. Some key assumptions are that our income tax rate is 40% and our SG&A (overhead selling, general, and admission expenses) rate is 20%. We also assume that 10% of people contacted through email/in-person get back to us, and 25% of those people take action and of those people that take action, 10% of them will buy our product. It costs us \$0.04 cents to get peoples’ attention on our product, \$0.0015 cents per contact, \$0.02 cents to respond back to a potential customer’s action, and \$0.27 cents for the cost associated with fulfilling a sale. How many people are telling each other about our product, the referral coefficient, is k = 0.2. The contact overlap is 0.25, the contact decay is 0.05, and the recurring coefficient is 0.55, so we will retain a majority of our initial customers the following year. We project that we will sell around 125 of our software packages to users during our initial scale year in 2023 netting us a profit of \$13k for our initial year.
